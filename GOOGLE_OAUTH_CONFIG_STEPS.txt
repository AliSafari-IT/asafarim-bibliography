# Google OAuth Configuration Steps

To fix the "redirect_uri_mismatch" error when using Google Sign-In, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Find and edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add both:
   - https://bibliography.asafarim.com
   - https://bibliography.asafarim.com/auth
   
6. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", make sure you have:
   - https://bibliography.asafarim.com

7. Click "Save"

8. For local development, also ensure you have:
   - http://localhost:3004 as an Authorized JavaScript origin
   - http://localhost:3004/auth as an Authorized redirect URI

It may take up to 5 minutes for changes to take effect in Google's systems.
